## PRIORITY EVIDENCE ANALYSIS

### Priority 1: Achieve 80%+ test coverage - Add unit tests, publish coverage to wiki, document all interfaces
**Status**: ✅ APPLICABLE

**Evidence Found**:
- **Codebase**: 
  - TEST_AUDIT_REPORT.md shows comprehensive test suite with 6 test files (4,787 lines)
  - Makefile includes test-coverage target with coverage reporting
  - All packages have *_test.go files with extensive test coverage
- **Recent Commits**: 
  - b26280c57306bf5f "feat: implement comprehensive test audit system"
  - 39ef4776179b67ce "fix: [Feature] Comprehensive test audit"
- **Existing Issues**: 
  - Issue #15 (resolved) addressed test audit and quality
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - Makefile test-coverage target: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`
  - CI workflow includes test execution
  - TEST_AUDIT_REPORT.md documents current testing status

**Evidence Score**: 4/4 evidence types

**Rationale**: The repository already has a strong testing foundation with comprehensive test files, coverage tooling in place, and recent focus on test quality. The TEST_AUDIT_REPORT shows excellent test discipline with 150+ test functions and zero audit issues found. Achieving 80%+ coverage and documentation is a natural next step.

### Priority 2: Support tenant-scoped storage - Ensure all operations respect tenant boundaries
**Status**: ✅ APPLICABLE

**Evidence Found**:
- **Codebase**: 
  - storage/models.go contains TenantID field in GenerateUploadURLRequest
  - auth/models.go contains TenantID field in ClientCredentialCreateRequest
  - Multi-tenant architecture patterns evident in auth models
- **Recent Commits**: 
  - Recent commits show no specific tenant boundary work, indicating this is needed
- **Existing Issues**: 
  - No existing issues addressing tenant isolation
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - JWT token-based authentication supports tenant context
  - Storage client has TokenProvider interface for auth integration

**Evidence Score**: 2/4 evidence types

**Rationale**: Tenant support is partially implemented with TenantID fields in key models, but the priority specifically mentions "ensure all operations respect tenant boundaries" which suggests incomplete implementation. The storage client and auth models show tenant awareness but lack comprehensive tenant isolation patterns.

### Priority 3: Document service interfaces - Complete API documentation and integration patterns
**Status**: ✅ APPLICABLE

**Evidence Found**:
- **Codebase**: 
  - Comprehensive docs/ directory with 7 documentation files
  - INTEGRATION.md (30KB) provides detailed integration patterns
  - ARCHITECTURE.md documents system design
  - Each service package has README.md files
- **Recent Commits**: 
  - 0e1f8ac3f7fc2342 "Add DEPLOYMENT.md for SDK distribution and integration guidance"
  - 501e1df1cc78b16f "Create docs/TESTING.md with comprehensive testing strategy"
  - f6d923fe42396ace "Create APPROACH.md with technical strategy and patterns"
- **Existing Issues**: 
  - Issue #8 (resolved) addressed documentation integration points
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - Well-structured docs/ directory with multiple specialized documentation files
  - README.md provides comprehensive usage examples

**Evidence Score**: 4/4 evidence types

**Rationale**: The repository shows strong commitment to documentation with extensive recent work on documentation files, comprehensive docs directory, and resolved issues addressing documentation gaps. However, the priority mentions "complete API documentation" suggesting some interfaces may still need documentation.

## FILTERED PRIORITIES

### Applicable Priorities (2+ evidence types)
1. **Achieve 80%+ test coverage**: Strong testing foundation exists, coverage tooling in place, recent test quality focus
2. **Support tenant-scoped storage**: Partial implementation evident, TenantID fields present, needs completion
3. **Document service interfaces**: Comprehensive documentation framework exists, recent documentation improvements

### Skipped Priorities (<2 evidence types)
- None - all three priorities show sufficient evidence for applicability

## TECHNOLOGY ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT
### Repository Type Classification
- **Type**: SDK Library (multi-service Go client library)
- **Complexity Level**: Moderate (4 service clients with shared utilities)
- **Deployment Readiness**: Production (well-structured with CI/CD)

### Priority-Repository Fit Analysis
All three priorities align well with the SDK's current state and needs:

1. **Test Coverage Priority**: Excellent fit - the repository already demonstrates strong testing discipline and has infrastructure for coverage reporting. Moving to 80%+ coverage is a natural progression.

2. **Tenant-Scoped Storage Priority**: Good fit - multi-tenant patterns are partially implemented in models, indicating this was a planned feature. Completing tenant boundary enforcement aligns with enterprise SDK requirements.

3. **Documentation Priority**: Excellent fit - the repository shows commitment to comprehensive documentation with extensive recent work. Completing API documentation aligns with SDK best practices and user needs.

## NEXT STEPS
Based on this analysis, the next prompt should focus on epic management for these applicable priorities:

1. **Test Coverage Epic**: Measure current coverage, identify gaps, implement missing tests, publish coverage reports
2. **Tenant Isolation Epic**: Complete tenant boundary implementation across all storage operations, add tenant validation
3. **API Documentation Epic**: Document remaining service interfaces, complete integration patterns, add inline documentation
