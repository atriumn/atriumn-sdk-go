# Epic Strategy & Cleanup Plan

## META
- Repository: atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go
- Strategy Date: 2025-06-02T15:30:00Z
- Based on Analysis: REPO_ANALYSIS.md from 2025-06-02T15:14:32Z

## INPUT SUMMARY
### Applicable Priorities (from analysis)
1. **Achieve 80%+ test coverage**: Strong testing foundation exists with comprehensive test files, coverage tooling in place (Makefile test-coverage target), and recent test quality focus. TEST_AUDIT_REPORT shows excellent test discipline with 150+ test functions.
2. **Support tenant-scoped storage**: Partial implementation evident with TenantID fields in models (storage/models.go, auth/models.go), multi-tenant architecture patterns present, but needs completion of tenant boundary enforcement across all operations.
3. **Document service interfaces**: Comprehensive documentation framework exists with extensive docs/ directory (7 files, 30KB INTEGRATION.md), recent documentation improvements, but priority mentions "complete API documentation" suggesting some interfaces still need documentation.

### Repository Profile
- **Type**: SDK Library (multi-service Go client library)
- **Tech Stack**: Go 1.24.0, minimal external dependencies (testify v1.10.0)
- **Core Purpose**: Official Go SDK for Atriumn services providing idiomatic Go clients for authentication, storage, AI, and content ingestion

## CURRENT EPIC INVENTORY

### Existing Epics Analysis
No existing epics found in the repository. All epic management will involve creating new epics aligned with the applicable priorities.

## EPIC MANAGEMENT PLAN

### Priority 1: Achieve 80%+ test coverage
**Epic Action**: CREATE NEW
**Epic Title**: "Epic: Achieve 80%+ Test Coverage and Quality"
**Scope**: Measure current test coverage across all packages, identify coverage gaps, implement missing unit and integration tests, establish coverage reporting and monitoring, document all public interfaces with examples
**Rationale**: Repository already has excellent testing infrastructure (6 test files, 4,787 lines of test code, Makefile coverage target) and shows strong testing discipline. Achieving 80%+ coverage is a natural progression that will ensure SDK reliability for consuming applications.

### Priority 2: Support tenant-scoped storage
**Epic Action**: CREATE NEW
**Epic Title**: "Epic: Complete Tenant-Scoped Storage Implementation"
**Scope**: Complete tenant boundary enforcement across all storage operations, implement tenant validation in all service clients, ensure all operations respect tenant context, add tenant isolation tests, document multi-tenant usage patterns
**Rationale**: Foundation is partially implemented with TenantID fields in key models (GenerateUploadURLRequest, ClientCredentialCreateRequest) and JWT token-based auth supporting tenant context. Completing this aligns with enterprise SDK requirements and ensures secure multi-tenant operations.

### Priority 3: Document service interfaces
**Epic Action**: CREATE NEW
**Epic Title**: "Epic: Complete API Documentation and Integration Patterns"
**Scope**: Document all remaining service interfaces with comprehensive API documentation, complete integration patterns documentation, add inline code documentation for all public methods, create usage examples for complex scenarios, establish documentation maintenance process
**Rationale**: Strong documentation foundation exists (comprehensive docs/ directory, recent documentation work), but "complete API documentation" suggests gaps remain. This aligns with SDK best practices and improves developer experience for SDK consumers.

## ISSUE CLEANUP PLAN

### Issues to Close
No issues identified for closure. The single open issue (#20) is a valid cleanup task that should be completed.

### Issues to Icebox
No issues identified for icebox. The repository has a clean issue landscape with only one active cleanup task.

### Issues to Reassign
| Issue # | Title | Current Epic | Target Epic | Reason |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| #20 | Remove development artifacts from repository | None | None (Complete independently) | This is a simple cleanup task that doesn't belong to any epic and should be completed as part of repository hygiene |

## ISSUE-EPIC ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY

### Epic 1: Achieve 80%+ Test Coverage and Quality
**Issues to Assign**:
- *New issues to be created during epic implementation*
  - Measure current test coverage across all packages
  - Identify and implement missing unit tests for uncovered functions
  - Add integration tests for client-to-service workflows
  - Establish coverage monitoring and reporting
  - Document testing patterns and standards

**Priority Order**:
1. Coverage measurement and gap analysis - establishes baseline
2. Unit test implementation for core service clients - highest impact
3. Integration test development - ensures end-to-end functionality
4. Coverage reporting automation - ensures sustainability

**Dependencies**:
- Coverage measurement must be completed before gap analysis
- Integration tests depend on complete unit test coverage
- Reporting automation requires coverage measurement framework

### Epic 2: Complete Tenant-Scoped Storage Implementation
**Issues to Assign**:
- *New issues to be created during epic implementation*
  - Audit all storage operations for tenant boundary enforcement
  - Implement tenant validation across all service clients
  - Add tenant context to operations missing TenantID support
  - Create tenant isolation integration tests
  - Document multi-tenant SDK usage patterns

**Priority Order**:
1. Tenant boundary audit - identifies scope of work
2. Storage client tenant enforcement - core functionality
3. Auth and AI client tenant validation - consistency across services
4. Tenant isolation testing - ensures security
5. Multi-tenant documentation - enables proper usage

**Dependencies**:
- Tenant boundary audit must precede implementation work
- Testing depends on completed tenant enforcement implementation
- Documentation requires completed tenant feature set

### Epic 3: Complete API Documentation and Integration Patterns
**Issues to Assign**:
- *New issues to be created during epic implementation*
  - Audit existing API documentation for completeness gaps
  - Add inline documentation for all public methods and types
  - Create comprehensive usage examples for each service client
  - Document complex integration scenarios and best practices
  - Establish documentation maintenance and review process

**Priority Order**:
1. Documentation gap analysis - identifies work scope
2. Inline code documentation - improves immediate developer experience
3. Usage examples creation - demonstrates proper SDK usage
4. Complex scenario documentation - covers advanced use cases
5. Maintenance process establishment - ensures long-term quality

**Dependencies**:
- Gap analysis must be completed before implementation work
- Usage examples depend on complete inline documentation
- Maintenance process requires established documentation standards

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### Phase 1: Cleanup
1. Complete issue #20: Remove development artifacts (output.json, output.txt)
2. Update .gitignore to prevent re-adding development artifacts
3. Verify repository compliance with Atriumn documentation standards

### Phase 2: Epic Management
1. Create Epic for Priority 1: "Epic: Achieve 80%+ Test Coverage and Quality"
2. Create Epic for Priority 2: "Epic: Complete Tenant-Scoped Storage Implementation"  
3. Create Epic for Priority 3: "Epic: Complete API Documentation and Integration Patterns"
4. Add epic scope and acceptance criteria to each epic issue

### Phase 3: Issue Assignment
1. Create initial planning issues for each epic (gap analysis, audit tasks)
2. Assign planning issues to respective epics using "Part of: Epic #X" in descriptions
3. Define dependencies between epic planning tasks
4. Establish epic implementation order based on dependencies and impact

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- [x] Each applicable priority has exactly one epic planned
- [x] No duplicate epics covering same scope
- [x] All cleanup actions have clear rationale with evidence  
- [x] Issue assignments logical and dependency-aware
- [x] Epic scopes match repository capabilities (SDK library with strong foundation)

## NEXT STEPS
The execution prompt should:
1. Execute cleanup plan (complete issue #20 independently)
2. Execute epic management plan (create 3 epics as specified)
3. Execute issue assignment plan (create initial planning issues for each epic)
4. Log all actions taken for final wiki documentation

**Success Metrics**:
- Repository achieves 80%+ test coverage with automated monitoring
- All storage operations properly enforce tenant boundaries with comprehensive testing
- Complete API documentation with usage examples for all service interfaces
- Clean, organized epic structure supporting long-term SDK development

**Timeline Estimate**: 
- Phase 1 (Cleanup): 1-2 days
- Phase 2 (Epic Creation): 1 day  
- Phase 3 (Initial Planning): 2-3 days
- Epic Implementation: 2-4 weeks per epic (can be parallelized)
