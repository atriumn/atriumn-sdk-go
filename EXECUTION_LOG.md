### Orphaned Issues (not assigned to any epic)
| Issue # | Title | Reason Not Assigned |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| [#20](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/20) | Remove development artifacts from repository | Simple cleanup task to be completed independently, not epic-worthy |

## VALIDATION RESULTS
- [x] All planned cleanup actions executed (none required)
- [x] All planned epic management actions executed (3 epics created)
- [x] All planned issue assignments executed (3 planning issues created and assigned)
- [x] Epic progress calculations updated (all at 0% - planning phase)
- [x] No broken dependencies created (all dependencies properly documented)
- [x] All issues properly categorized (3 assigned to epics, 1 documented as orphaned)

## ISSUES ENCOUNTERED
No issues encountered during execution. All planned actions completed successfully according to the EPIC_STRATEGY.md specifications.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Strategy Adherence
The execution followed the EPIC_STRATEGY.md plan exactly:
- **Phase 1 (Cleanup)**: No cleanup actions required - Issue #20 remains open as valid task
- **Phase 2 (Epic Management)**: Successfully created 3 strategic epics aligned with applicable priorities
- **Phase 3 (Issue Assignment)**: Created foundational planning issues for each epic with proper dependencies

### Epic Structure
Each epic follows a consistent structure:
- Clear priority and scope definition
- Evidence from REPO_ANALYSIS.md supporting the epic
- Phased approach with dependencies
- Success criteria and progress tracking
- Strategic rationale for why this epic matters

### Planning Issues
Created foundation issues for each epic:
- **Issue #24**: Coverage measurement baseline (Epic #21)
- **Issue #25**: Tenant boundary audit (Epic #22)  
- **Issue #26**: Documentation gap analysis (Epic #23)

These planning issues are designed to:
- Establish baseline understanding before implementation
- Block implementation work until analysis is complete
- Provide data-driven foundation for subsequent issue creation

## NEXT STEPS
The gap analysis and finalization prompt should:
1. Monitor completion of planning issues #24, #25, #26
2. Create implementation issues based on findings from planning issues
3. Develop detailed work queue from epic priorities
4. Generate comprehensive wiki documentation of sprint structure
5. Establish ongoing epic progress monitoring

## STRATEGIC OUTCOMES

The epic execution has established a comprehensive sprint planning structure for atriumn-sdk-go:

### **Strategic Epic Coverage**
- **Testing Excellence**: Epic #21 builds on existing strong test foundation to achieve 80%+ coverage
- **Enterprise Security**: Epic #22 completes tenant isolation for enterprise SDK requirements  
- **Developer Experience**: Epic #23 enhances API documentation for SDK consumers

### **Repository Alignment**
All epics align with the repository's SDK library nature and existing strengths:
- Leverages existing test infrastructure and discipline
- Builds on partial tenant implementation already present
- Extends comprehensive documentation foundation already established

### **Implementation Ready**
The structure is now ready for systematic implementation:
- Clear epic priorities and dependencies
- Foundation planning issues to drive data-driven decisions
- Organized issue assignment strategy for each epic phase
- Progress tracking and success criteria established

---
**Execution Complete**: 3 epics created, 3 planning issues assigned, comprehensive structure established for sprint implementation.
