## EPIC DETAILS

### Epic: Achieve 80%+ Test Coverage and Quality - [#21](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/21)
**Scope**: Measure current test coverage across all packages, identify coverage gaps, implement missing unit and integration tests, establish coverage reporting and monitoring, document all public interfaces with examples
**Progress**: 0/2 issues = 0%
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Planning
**Next Actions**: 
- [#24](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/24): Establish coverage baseline measurement
- [#27](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/27): Integrate coverage into CI/CD pipeline

### Epic: Complete Tenant-Scoped Storage Implementation - [#22](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/22)
**Scope**: Complete tenant boundary enforcement across all storage operations, implement tenant validation in all service clients, ensure all operations respect tenant context, add tenant isolation tests, document multi-tenant usage patterns
**Progress**: 0/1 issues = 0%
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Planning
**Next Actions**: 
- [#25](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/25): Audit tenant boundary enforcement gaps

### Epic: Complete API Documentation and Integration Patterns - [#23](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/23)
**Scope**: Document all remaining service interfaces with comprehensive API documentation, complete integration patterns documentation, add inline code documentation for all public methods, create usage examples for complex scenarios, establish documentation maintenance process
**Progress**: 0/2 issues = 0%
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Planning
**Next Actions**: 
- [#26](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/26): Audit API documentation completeness
- [#28](https://github.com/atriumn/atriumn-sdk-go/issues/28): Enhance documentation linting enforcement

## REPOSITORY HEALTH
- **Test Coverage**: Strong foundation with 6 test files (4,787 lines), TEST_AUDIT_REPORT shows 150+ test functions, baseline measurement needed
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs/ directory (7 files, 30KB INTEGRATION.md), recent improvements, consistency enforcement needed
- **CI/CD Status**: Centralized workflow integration, coverage reporting integration needed
- **Technical Debt**: Clean codebase, minor cleanup task (issue #20) for development artifacts

## NEXT REBOOT TRIGGERS
Consider next backlog reboot when:
- Epic progress stalls for >30 days
- New major features planned outside current epic scope
- Repository architecture changes significantly
- Priority alignment shifts
