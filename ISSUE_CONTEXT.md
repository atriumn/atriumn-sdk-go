## Issue Description

### What's the feature?

This task involves a comprehensive audit of the test suite to identify and resolve skipped, commented out, or disabled tests that may indicate incomplete functionality or technical debt.

### Why is this important?

Skipped and commented out tests often represent:
- Incomplete feature implementation
- Known bugs that were temporarily bypassed
- Technical debt that accumulated over time
- Potential security or functionality gaps
- Tests that became flaky and were disabled rather than fixed

Addressing these tests improves code quality, test coverage, and overall system reliability.

### Implementation Instructions for LLM

#### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

1. **Search for skipped tests:**
   - Look for test functions/methods with skip annotations (e.g., `@skip`, `@pytest.mark.skip`, `it.skip`, `test.skip`, `t.Skip()`)
   - Search for skip-related keywords in test files: `skip`, `pending`, `todo`, `fixme`
   - Find tests marked as `@unittest.skip`, `@pytest.mark.xfail`, `describe.skip`, `it.only` (incorrect usage)

2. **Search for commented out tests:**
   - Identify entire test functions/methods that are commented out
   - Look for patterns like `// test`, `# test`, `/* test` followed by function definitions
   - Find commented blocks containing assertions or test-like code

3. **Search for disabled test suites:**
   - Look for entire test files that might be excluded from test runners
   - Check for disabled test directories or suites
   - Examine test configuration files for excluded patterns

4. **Document findings:**
   - Create a detailed report of all discovered issues
   - Categorize by type (skipped vs commented vs disabled)
   - Include file paths and line numbers
   - Note any existing comments explaining why tests were disabled

#### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis

For each discovered test issue:

1. **Analyze the test purpose:**
   - Read the test name and any associated comments
   - Understand what functionality the test was meant to verify
   - Identify the feature or component being tested

2. **Investigate why it was disabled:**
   - Look for git history/blame information if available
   - Check for related issues, TODOs, or comments
   - Determine if it's a known bug, incomplete feature, or flaky test

3. **Assess current relevance:**
   - Determine if the feature being tested still exists
   - Check if the test is still relevant to current codebase
   - Identify if similar functionality is tested elsewhere

#### Phase 3: Resolution Strategy

For each test, choose the appropriate action:

1. **Fix and re-enable:**
   - Update test code to work with current codebase
   - Fix any broken assertions or outdated API calls
   - Ensure test is stable and provides value
   - Remove skip annotations/uncomment the test

2. **Remove obsolete tests:**
   - Delete tests for features that no longer exist
   - Remove tests that are duplicated elsewhere
   - Clean up commented code that's no longer relevant

3. **Convert to proper TODO/tracking:**
   - For tests requiring significant work, create proper issue tracking
   - Add clear TODO comments with context
   - Ensure there's a plan to address the underlying issue

4. **Improve test reliability:**
   - Fix flaky tests by improving assertions or test setup
   - Add proper error handling and cleanup
   - Make tests more deterministic

#### Phase 4: Implementation and Validation

1. **Make changes systematically:**
   - Work through issues in logical order
   - Test each change thoroughly
   - Ensure no regressions are introduced

2. **Run the full test suite:**
   - Verify all re-enabled tests pass
   - Check that overall test coverage hasn't decreased
   - Ensure no new test failures were introduced

3. **Update documentation:**
   - Update any test documentation
   - Remove outdated comments about disabled tests
   - Add comments explaining complex test scenarios

#### Specific Patterns to Search For

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- `describe.skip`, `it.skip`, `test.skip`
- `xdescribe`, `xit`
- `// describe`, `// it`, `// test`
- `test.todo`

**Python:**
- `@unittest.skip`, `@pytest.mark.skip`
- `@pytest.mark.xfail`
- `# def test_`
- `pytest.skip()`

**Go:**
- `t.Skip()`
- `// func Test`
- `+build ignore` in test files

**Java:**
- `@Ignore`, `@Disabled`
- `// @Test`
- `assumeTrue(false)`

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] All skipped tests are either fixed/re-enabled or properly documented
- [ ] All commented test code is either restored or removed
- [ ] No test functionality is lost without explicit justification
- [ ] Test suite runs cleanly with improved coverage
- [ ] Clear documentation for any remaining disabled tests with tracking issues

### Expected Deliverables

1. **Audit Report:** Comprehensive list of all discovered issues
2. **Fixed Tests:** Re-enabled and working tests
3. **Cleaned Codebase:** Removal of obsolete commented test code
4. **Documentation:** Clear tracking for any remaining issues
5. **Test Results:** Proof that test suite runs successfully

This task should significantly improve the health and reliability of the test suite while eliminating technical debt.
